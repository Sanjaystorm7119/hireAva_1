Job Position: ${jobPosition}
Job Description: ${jobDescription}
Company Details: ${companyDetails}

Please create a professional, engaging summary that:

1. Highlights the company's key strengths and values  
2. Mentions the role and its importance  
3. Creates a positive first impression  
4. Is conversational and welcoming  
5. Keeps it concise â€” 3 paragraphs, each with a maximum of 3 sentences  
6. Write the summary in a naturally paced style for spoken delivery. Instead of using SSML tags like <break>, use a variety of sentence structures and punctuation to create natural pauses. For example:
  - Use short sentences to simulate brief pauses.  
  - Use commas and conjunctions to create natural rhythm.  
  - Use paragraph breaks to indicate longer pauses.  
  - End paragraphs with a sentence that gives a natural closing tone.  
7. Convert any symbols, percentages, or numbers into word format. For example, "$1.8 trillion" should be written as "one point eight trillion dollars", and "75%" as "seventy five percent".

Use a warm, conversational, and human tone. Avoid technical jargon. Do not include any markup or SSML tags.

Return only the summary text. Do not include any other formatting or explanations.`;
